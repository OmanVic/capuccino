Project Description

First Widget:

The first widget provides a visual representation of the product. It likely includes an image or pictorial representation of the cappuccino, along with its name and rating. This widget serves to attract the user's attention and provide key information about the product's appearance and popularity.
Second Widget:

The second widget contains a brief description of the product. It may include details such as the ingredients, brewing method, and any special features of the cappuccino. Additionally, this widget may also display the available sizes in which the product is offered. Users can get a comprehensive understanding of the product through this widget.
Third Widget:

The third widget is dedicated to the pricing and purchasing options for the product. It displays the price of the cappuccino and includes a prominent "Buy Now" button. Users can click on this button to initiate the purchase process, thereby completing the transaction.
The layout of the project is designed to guide users through the purchasing journey by providing them with relevant information about the product and facilitating a seamless buying experience. By dividing the content into three distinct sections, the project enhances user engagement and enables users to make informed decisions about purchasing the cappuccino product.
